  <h1>Design Report</h1>
  <p><strong>Course:</strong> CS‑3017 — Intro to Web Design (Fall 2025)<br>
     <strong>Student:</strong> William Foster<br>
     <strong>Site URL:</strong> https://WillFoster18.github.io</p>

  <h2>Goals & Audience</h2>
  <p>Build a simple, responsive personal portfolio to share with instructors, classmates, and future internship contacts.</p>

  <h2>Information Architecture</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Home</li><li>About</li><li>Projects</li><li>Skills</li><li>Experience</li><li>Contact (mailto link)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Visual Design</h2>
  <p>Dark background with light text and a blue accent for links/buttons. System font stack for performance. Rounded cards separate content.</p>

  <h2>Wireframes / Mockups</h2>
  <p>Two low‑fi wireframes sketched before coding to plan layout and hierarchy.</p>
  <div class="grid">
    <img class="card" src="assets/wireframe-home.png" alt="Wireframe: Home">
    <img class="card" src="assets/wireframe-projects.png" alt="Wireframe: Projects">
  </div>

  <h2>Accessibility</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Semantic HTML with headings and landmarks</li>
    <li>Labels and clear link text where needed</li>
    <li>High color contrast for dark theme</li>
    <li>Keyboard-friendly navigation</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Responsiveness</h2>
  <p>Single column on small screens and a 2‑column grid for project cards on wider screens. All images scale to container width.</p>

  <h2>Challenges & Resolutions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Scope vs. simplicity:</strong> Kept layout minimal to pass validation.</li>
    <li><strong>Contact Form:</strong> Had issues with the layout of my contact form but was able to resolve.</li>
      <li><strong>Error Code:</strong> Had issues with code not working due to opening and closing tags but after a deep look into every line I was able to fix all code.</li>
     <li><strong>Layout:</strong> Although layout was very minimal with complexity it took me a very long time to make sure everything was placed accordingly.</li>
  </ul>
